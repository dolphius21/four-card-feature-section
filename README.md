# Frontend Mentor - Four card feature section

[Design preview for the Four card feature section coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

This is a four card feature section challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) I styled this using Sass and I got a chance to learn how powerful CSS Grid when it comes to responsive web design, I always use flexbox when designing, but now that I fully understand how CSS Grid works, I surely will be significantly relying on it moving forward.
